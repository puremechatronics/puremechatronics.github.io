title: About Us
---

Our mechanical and design engineers are an essential part of the development and launch of any just about new or improved product. They are the ones who bring an expertise in mechanics, electronics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, material science and energy mechanics to a project. Many of them also act as project managers for multidisciplinary projects. With their extensive experience, they have a deep empathy for the entire product development process and go beyond just “making it work.”
